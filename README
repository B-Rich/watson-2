watson is a simple command line tool for 
generating a wiki. you pass it a directory 
with your notes. these files are run through
markdown, threaded into a layout you provide,
and ouputed into a 'wiki' directory in the 
notes directory. A web server is fired up to 
serve them to your locally. top hat also creates
an index page with a list of all other pages.
of course, syntax is highlighted.

watson is still rough around the edges. if you
find a bug, or a feature that shouldbe available,
fork the project, and add your line to the TODO 
file.  send me a pull request, and i'll merge it.
or better yet, add the feature or fix the bug 
yourself for faster results. but the best way 
to help out is send me your feedback. it keeps
me inspired to do more.
